My Introduction-<br/>
Name-Nikhil Raj<br/>
Roll no.-220123042<br/>
Branch-Mathematics and Computing<br/>
I belong to Bihar. Before coming to Guwahati, I was in Delhi for last 5 years because of my father's transfer. My hobbies are
facial sketching, singing, writing songs and poems, playing and learing new things. Recently, I have done many courses intoduced
by different clubs of IITG for example the course on block chain, flutter and even currently doing the course released by the ai club.

I want to contribute to open source to improve my skill set and be in regular practice of what I learn. Contributing to open source also 
helps in collaboration and networking and even would improve my portfolio.
